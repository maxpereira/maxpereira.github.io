				<font id="hello">Hello.</font>
				<p>This site is meant to serve as a long-form résumé, showcasing both my professional experience as well as experience gained by tinkering with my homelab.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Homelab</h3>
				<p>The core of my homelab is a Proxmox hypervisor running several virtual machines hosting various services for personal use. The virtual machines are orchestrated with Terraform and configured with Ansible. Most services are running as Docker containers except OpenVPN which is running on a dedicated virtual machine.</p>

				<h3>Experiments</h3>
				<p>Sometimes I get an idea that I can't get out of my head until I see it visualized. Usually these are little Javascript experiments to showcase some phenomenon or test some kind of theory. I like to share these in case someone else finds them interesting.</p>
