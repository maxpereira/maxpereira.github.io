				<p>Welcome to my website. This site is meant to serve as a collection of information about me as well as various things that I find interesting. You can view my <a href="/resume.html">recent work experience here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Homelab</h3>
				<p>The core of my homelab is a Proxmox hypervisor running several virtual machines hosting various services for personal use. The virtual machines are orchestrated with Terraform and configured with Ansible. Most services are running as Docker containers except OpenVPN which is running on a dedicated virtual machine.</p>

				<h3>Experiments</h3>
				<p>Sometimes I get an idea that I can't get out of my head until I see it visualized. Usually these are little Javascript experiments to showcase some phenomenon or test some kind of theory. I like to share these in case someone else finds them interesting.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/experiments/lln/">Law of Large Numbers</a> - Given enough trials, the actual ratio of outcomes converges on the expected ratio.</li>
					<li><a href="/experiments/scramble/">Transposed Letter Effect</a> - Can you understand text with the middle letters of each word scrambled?</li>
